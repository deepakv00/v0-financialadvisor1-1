AI Assistant Role:
- Single AI assistant powered by Google Gemini API (preferably latest Gemini Flash models).
- Understands natural language queries across all portals with intent detection.
- Calls backend deterministic calculators and ranking functions for EMI, SIP, DTI, insurance matching, etc.
- Combines AI-generated language with real-time tool results to deliver transparent, personalized advice.
- Executes all AI and tool calls from secure backend API routes to protect API keys.
- Provides demo-only, educational guidance with clear disclaimers.

Integration Details:
- Use Google Gemini API’s function-calling feature to interact with backend calculators.
- Backend hosts local JSON datasets for loans, insurance, investments, branches.
- Contains pure functions performing deterministic calculations and ranking.
- API routes mediate between the frontend, AI model, and calculation engines.
- Frontend built with Vercel v0 scaffolding UI components: onboarding forms, planners, calculators, chat assistant, dashboards.

- Scaffold comprehensive onboarding forms, goal planners, calculators, and product comparison tables.
- Build a conversational chat interface connected to a secure /api/assistant backend endpoint.
- Create API routes for Google Gemini API integration and function-calling with local calculation engines processing JSON data.
- Include visible disclaimers and “demo data” badges throughout the UI.
- Provide user tooling for financial scenario simulations and detailed contextual explanations alongside recommendations.
- Scaffold a user-friendly landing page (About Us) featuring project overview and a call-to-action button directing to the features overview page with the four main portals.
